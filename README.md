List of libraries I used:
GLFW, 
GLAD, 
GLM.

At first I was just developing a physical 3D engine, and then I realized that I could make a pong game. I decided to make the game a little more difficult with every goal scored by the player. Thus, the more goals a player scores, the faster his opponent will move. If you change the size of the playing field in the code, then all the remaining objects on the scene will change their location depending on the size and location of the main platform.
